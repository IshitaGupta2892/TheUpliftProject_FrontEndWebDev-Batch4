                <h2>Who Was Mother Teresa?</h2>
                <p>Nun and missionary Mother Teresa, known in the Catholic church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, devoted
                    her life to caring for the sick and poor. Born in Macedonia to parents of Albanian-descent and
                    having taught in India for 17 years, Mother Teresa experienced her "call within a call" in 1946. Her
                    order established a hospice; centers for the blind, aged and disabled; and a leper colony. In 1979
                    she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. She died in September 1997 and was
                    beatified in October 2003. In December 2015, Pope Francis recognized a second miracle attributed to
                    Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized on September 4, 2016. </p><br>

                <h2>Missionaries of Charity</h2>
                <p>She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[26] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a
                    simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several
                    months in
                    Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.[40][41]
                    She
                    founded a school in Motijhil, Kolkata, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.[42] At the
                    beginning of 1949 Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the
                    foundation
                    for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor"</p><br>

                <h2> Controversy</h2>
                <p>In 1995, she publicly advocated a "no" vote in the Irish referendum to end the country's
                    constitutional
                    ban
                    on divorce and remarriage. The most scathing criticism of Mother Teresa can be found in Christopher
                    Hitchens's book The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice, in which Hitchens
                    argued
                    that
                    Mother Teresa glorified poverty for her own ends and provided a justification for the preservation
                    of
                    institutions and beliefs that sustained widespread poverty.</p> <br>

            <h2>Awards and Praises</h2>
            <p>In February 1965, Pope Paul VI bestowed the Decree of Praise upon the Missionaries of Charity, which
                prompted Mother Teresa to begin expanding internationally. By the time of her death in 1997, the
                Missionaries of Charity numbered more than 4,000 — in addition to thousands more lay volunteers — with
                610 foundations in 123 countries around the world</p><br>
